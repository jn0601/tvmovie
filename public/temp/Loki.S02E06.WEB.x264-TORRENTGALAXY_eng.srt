1
00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:04,043
I am Loki of Asgard.

2
00:00:04,126 --> 00:00:06,501
And I am burdened with glorious purpose.

3
00:00:08,834 --> 00:00:12,084
You found out you're a Variant
and you haven't even looked, have you?

4
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:15,043
-You wanna be king?
-I don't want to be, I was born to be.

5
00:00:15,126 --> 00:00:18,126
That is what we know.
War. And it's on its way.

6
00:00:18,209 --> 00:00:20,293
-That's who you showed us?
-He Who Remains.

7
00:00:20,376 --> 00:00:21,751
This is his kingdom.

8
00:00:22,418 --> 00:00:24,751
And that's the gambit.

9
00:00:24,834 --> 00:00:29,876
Take over, or an infinite amount of me
start another Multiversal War.

10
00:00:29,959 --> 00:00:32,668
And I just end up right back here anyways.

11
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:34,709
Reincarnation, baby.

12
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:35,793
Sylvie, stop.

13
00:00:35,876 --> 00:00:37,459
You want the throne?

14
00:00:38,376 --> 00:00:39,459
See you soon.

15
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:41,834
Now, for better or for worse,
the timelines are free.

16
00:00:41,918 --> 00:00:45,251
It's up to us to protect them,
to do better than He Who Remains.

17
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:47,418
-We're playing God.
-What's the plan?

18
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:50,001
Load the Multiplier,
launch it and get back.

19
00:00:50,084 --> 00:00:51,293
Time to be brave.

20
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:56,918
The branches are dying.
Everything's falling apart.

21
00:00:57,001 --> 00:01:00,584
I need to go back to before
the Temporal Loom melted down.

22
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:03,251
You need to learn
how to control your time slipping.

23
00:02:12,043 --> 00:02:15,043
Load the Multiplier,
launch it and get back.

24
00:02:15,126 --> 00:02:16,709
- Got it?
- Got it.

25
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:19,459
Okay.

26
00:02:20,876 --> 00:02:22,293
Time to be brave.

27
00:02:23,334 --> 00:02:24,543
Good luck.

28
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:26,834
Time to be brave.

29
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:37,751
I'm back.

30
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,293
-You okay?
-Yes. Yes.

31
00:02:39,376 --> 00:02:40,876
We have to get Timely out there.

32
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:48,334
Ready.

33
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,001
- How long will he have?
- Not long.

34
00:02:50,084 --> 00:02:53,251
I don't know about this radiation level,
it's worse than when I was there.

35
00:02:53,334 --> 00:02:54,709
He'll make it.

36
00:02:56,376 --> 00:02:57,751
Be brave.

37
00:02:59,126 --> 00:03:00,584
Here we go.

38
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,668
- Come on, let's go! Let's go!
- Come on, let's move!

39
00:03:25,543 --> 00:03:26,626
What happened?

40
00:03:27,376 --> 00:03:28,751
He's gone.

41
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:29,918
It's over.

42
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:31,209
Okay, what do we do?

43
00:03:31,293 --> 00:03:33,751
The Temporal Radiation is just too high.

44
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,459
What did we do wrong?

45
00:03:35,543 --> 00:03:38,293
I don't know.
It wasn't me, I swear.

46
00:03:38,376 --> 00:03:39,959
- O.B.
- Is he dead?

47
00:03:40,043 --> 00:03:41,876
What could we have done differently?

48
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:43,126
Good question.

49
00:03:45,043 --> 00:03:46,293
We took too long.

50
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:56,043
Again. Faster.

51
00:03:56,126 --> 00:03:57,918
Okay. No time to argue.

52
00:03:58,043 --> 00:03:59,459
-Follow me.
-Good luck, professor.

53
00:04:00,251 --> 00:04:02,543
Listen. Get in, get suited up. When...

54
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:05,626
When those doors open,
get down the gangway as fast as you can.

55
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:09,084
Load the Multiplier, hit the green button,
launch it and get back. Okay?

56
00:04:09,168 --> 00:04:10,543
- Okay.
- That's exactly right.

57
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,834
Let's keep moving.
Let's go faster this time.

58
00:04:12,918 --> 00:04:14,418
- Time to be brave.
- You ready?

59
00:04:14,501 --> 00:04:15,584
"This time"?

60
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,418
-Okay. No time to argue.
-Good luck, professor.

61
00:04:22,501 --> 00:04:23,501
Listen...

62
00:04:23,584 --> 00:04:25,876
Get in. Get suited up.
Get down the gangway fast.

63
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:29,001
Load the Multiplier, hit the green button,
launch it and get back.

64
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:30,959
Keep moving. Go little faster this time.

65
00:04:31,043 --> 00:04:32,043
"This time"?

66
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:36,918
- What happened?
- He's gone.

67
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:39,584
- Again. Not faster, earlier.
- It's over.

68
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:43,043
Miss Ravonna, after what happened
in my workshop...

69
00:04:43,126 --> 00:04:46,293
Miss Minutes, I know right now
you're hurt and you're angry.

70
00:04:46,376 --> 00:04:49,293
But we need your help in finishing
the Throughput Multiplier, faster.

71
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:53,084
Time is of the essence.

72
00:04:56,668 --> 00:04:59,168
I wasted time and now the time wastes me.

73
00:04:59,251 --> 00:05:00,876
Don't set the Multiplier down.

74
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,168
Again.

75
00:05:04,126 --> 00:05:05,126
Come on!

76
00:05:06,126 --> 00:05:08,126
Again. Again.

77
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:10,834
Again.

78
00:05:13,626 --> 00:05:15,001
Come on, come on, come on.

79
00:05:22,209 --> 00:05:23,251
Again.

80
00:05:24,043 --> 00:05:28,543
Introductions. Ouroboros,
this is Victor Timely.

81
00:05:28,626 --> 00:05:31,084
Victor Timely, this is Ouroboros.
Guess what?

82
00:05:31,168 --> 00:05:34,834
The TVA Handbook, you both wrote it.
Isn't that amazing?

83
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:36,834
- Loki, why are you being so weird?
- O.B...

84
00:05:36,918 --> 00:05:38,001
Victor Timely?

85
00:05:38,084 --> 00:05:39,293
Ouroboros.

86
00:05:39,376 --> 00:05:41,626
- Hey, hey.
- Nice to meet you!

87
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:46,543
Here is a model of the Loom
which O.B. so helpfully mocked up.

88
00:05:46,626 --> 00:05:50,293
Everyone, Victor,
this model is not finished, okay?

89
00:05:50,376 --> 00:05:52,043
There's only one coat of paint on this.

90
00:05:52,126 --> 00:05:55,751
O.B., what are you talking about?
It's absolutely perfect.

91
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:59,334
Now listen up. We have to get Timely
suited up and to the Loom.

92
00:05:59,418 --> 00:06:01,543
Wait... Why me?

93
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:03,793
Because you volunteered,
you did, you will.

94
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:07,459
Something could go wrong,
and you know how the Multiplier works.

95
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:08,834
-I do.
-It'll make sense.

96
00:06:09,709 --> 00:06:12,334
You will wear this protective suit.

97
00:06:12,418 --> 00:06:13,751
Mobius, you're in luck.

98
00:06:13,834 --> 00:06:16,584
It looks like Mobius,
but it's actually Victor Timely.

99
00:06:16,668 --> 00:06:17,709
That's me?

100
00:06:17,793 --> 00:06:19,584
Victor, in this suit,
when those doors open,

101
00:06:19,668 --> 00:06:21,834
get down the gangway as fast as you can.

102
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:23,168
It's gonna take some doing,

103
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:25,501
-it's not gonna be easy.
-It's not gonna be easy...

104
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:26,918
Lot of Temporal Radiation.

105
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:28,584
- Everyone following? Good.
- Yes.

106
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:33,043
Victor, load the Multiplier
into the launcher, spin it,

107
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:36,918
hit the green button, which will launch it
where it'll dock with the Loom

108
00:06:37,001 --> 00:06:40,334
and scale its capacity to manage
the backlog of branches.

109
00:06:40,418 --> 00:06:43,209
- The Multiplier isn't ready yet.
- It is.

110
00:06:43,293 --> 00:06:46,959
-Because Timely has this.
-What's that...

111
00:06:47,543 --> 00:06:48,584
-A prototype...
-Yes.

112
00:06:48,668 --> 00:06:52,126
...which will widen the temporal input
and invert the temporal decay.

113
00:06:52,626 --> 00:06:55,418
This device,
plus the Throughput Multiplier,

114
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:59,584
will make the rings bigger.

115
00:06:59,668 --> 00:07:01,709
-Loki, give...
-Give that back to the professor.

116
00:07:01,793 --> 00:07:03,668
Thank you so much. Trust me.

117
00:07:03,751 --> 00:07:06,001
It'll take time to adapt
my Throughput Multiplier...

118
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:07,334
How long? How long?

119
00:07:07,709 --> 00:07:09,793
Depends. I don't even know
what I'm looking at.

120
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:10,876
What is that?

121
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,834
O.B., how long will it take me
to know everything that you know

122
00:07:13,918 --> 00:07:16,126
about mechanics, physics, and engineering?

123
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,668
How much do you know?

124
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:22,001
Let's assume I don't know much,
but I'm a fast learner and I'm a god.

125
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:24,543
-Let's start at the beginning.
-Start at the beginning.

126
00:07:24,626 --> 00:07:26,751
We don't have time.
It's better if we work alone.

127
00:07:26,834 --> 00:07:28,251
O.B., I understand.

128
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:29,584
But if I had to know,

129
00:07:29,668 --> 00:07:31,959
I mean, I really, really,
really had to know,

130
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:33,251
how long would it take?

131
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:36,668
-Decades.
-Centuries.

132
00:07:47,418 --> 00:07:51,084
Loki, I'm not questioning your
surprisingly advanced engineering skills,

133
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:53,126
but maybe O.B. should
test that thing first?

134
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:55,751
Testing protocol is key to safe
scientific advancement.

135
00:07:55,834 --> 00:07:58,126
It's perfect. Timely, need you this way.

136
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:01,376
We have to scan your Temporal Aura
in this fine machine.

137
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:03,918
-Now, it looks lethal.
-Is that...

138
00:08:04,001 --> 00:08:06,834
- It is absolutely safe. Watch this.
- Loki, Loki!

139
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:08,876
Access denied.

140
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,543
Your turn. I'll take those.

141
00:08:10,626 --> 00:08:12,084
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

142
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:13,709
-When you're ready.
-Ready.

143
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:15,001
And go.

144
00:08:15,543 --> 00:08:18,043
Welcome, He Who Remains.

145
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:20,501
- Can I, can I come out?
- And you're still here.

146
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,126
You'll need those.

147
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,043
Guys, it's worse than I thought.

148
00:08:24,126 --> 00:08:26,418
We have to move fast. Who's it gonna be?

149
00:08:26,501 --> 00:08:28,668
It's him. It's you. You volunteer.

150
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:30,751
Here's the plan. Get in, get suited up.

151
00:08:30,834 --> 00:08:33,543
When those doors open,
get down the gangway as fast as you can.

152
00:08:33,626 --> 00:08:35,501
Load the Multiplier, hit the green button,

153
00:08:35,584 --> 00:08:37,001
-launch it, and get back.
-Got it.

154
00:08:37,084 --> 00:08:38,668
By the way, remember,

155
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:41,126
tape your right thumb, left knee,
and faceplate

156
00:08:41,209 --> 00:08:43,459
or the Temporal Radiation
will peel your skin off.

157
00:08:43,543 --> 00:08:46,418
-Watch the first step, trip hazard.
-Thumb, knee, faceplate.

158
00:08:46,501 --> 00:08:48,084
-One last thing.
-Yes.

159
00:08:48,168 --> 00:08:50,918
Whatever you do,
do not set the Multiplier down,

160
00:08:51,001 --> 00:08:53,793
or it will roll off the gangway.
Okay? Don't forget.

161
00:08:54,543 --> 00:08:55,543
Be brave.

162
00:08:57,043 --> 00:08:58,834
Time to be brave.

163
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,501
Casey, we need to widen the voltage
input and invert the temporal decay.

164
00:09:04,584 --> 00:09:06,543
- What about the ion decoupler?
- It's fine.

165
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,126
- Route it with the primary compartment.
- Won't it overheat?

166
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:13,209
No. Allow it to interface with Timely's
adaptive exponential computing system.

167
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:15,126
Those upgrades will allow the Loom

168
00:09:15,209 --> 00:09:17,168
to scale the capacity
to manage the branches.

169
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,668
The rings. Rings are too small.

170
00:09:19,751 --> 00:09:22,084
We're gonna make them bigger. Let's go.

171
00:09:22,209 --> 00:09:23,334
Better watch out, O.B.

172
00:09:23,418 --> 00:09:25,709
-Someone's coming for your job.
-Coming for your job.

173
00:09:25,793 --> 00:09:28,376
That's right. I'm coming,
O.B., watch your back.

174
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:30,543
Casey, get the Multiplier down to Timely

175
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,751
-as fast as you can.
-Okay.

176
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,084
-What the shit are you doing?
-Trust me.

177
00:09:38,168 --> 00:09:39,793
-No.
-I know what I'm doing.

178
00:09:39,876 --> 00:09:41,876
-No!
-Watch.

179
00:09:47,418 --> 00:09:49,918
-Casey, don't forget to latch his helmet.
-Yeah.

180
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:52,543
- Latch his helmet.
- Thank you.

181
00:09:56,418 --> 00:09:58,876
-Mr. Timely's ready.
-I know.

182
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:04,168
Access denied.
Password required. Password accepted.

183
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:07,043
-Here we go.
-Yes!

184
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:11,126
Hang on. This all seems a bit rushed.

185
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:13,584
Only to you. Trust me.
If you stop, you die.

186
00:10:15,751 --> 00:10:16,751
All right.

187
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:19,626
Here we go.

188
00:10:39,376 --> 00:10:41,793
Get to the end of the gangway
as fast as you can,

189
00:10:41,876 --> 00:10:44,376
and then load the Multiplier
into the launcher.

190
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,668
That's it, one step at a time.

191
00:10:48,543 --> 00:10:51,376
Be brave. You're being so brave.

192
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:00,876
You're doing really well. Fantastic.

193
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,168
Keep going.

194
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:05,751
One foot in front of the other.

195
00:11:06,543 --> 00:11:09,543
Before you know it,
you'll be at the end of the gangway.

196
00:11:09,626 --> 00:11:10,876
Well done.

197
00:11:18,251 --> 00:11:20,668
He did it. He made it.

198
00:11:20,793 --> 00:11:21,834
Not yet.

199
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:28,668
Ah, ah! Victor, what did I tell you?

200
00:11:28,751 --> 00:11:32,709
Do not put the Multiplier down,
it will roll off the gangway.

201
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,376
Oh, my God, yes!

202
00:11:38,918 --> 00:11:41,876
That's right. Well done.
Now load it into the launcher.

203
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,418
Come on.

204
00:12:07,168 --> 00:12:08,293
Come on.

205
00:12:15,293 --> 00:12:18,126
-He's got it.
-Right. Listen to me carefully.

206
00:12:18,209 --> 00:12:20,001
Hit the green button.

207
00:12:21,876 --> 00:12:25,293
Hit the green button.

208
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:32,459
No.

209
00:12:33,793 --> 00:12:35,251
Hit the button.

210
00:12:35,334 --> 00:12:36,876
It can be a little sticky.

211
00:12:38,043 --> 00:12:41,001
Hit the green button!

212
00:12:49,168 --> 00:12:50,293
Yes!

213
00:12:53,084 --> 00:12:55,376
Now come back, quick.

214
00:12:55,459 --> 00:12:57,793
Get back, get back.

215
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,084
- Back?
- Yes, come back.

216
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:05,168
It's working. It's working.
It's gonna work this time.

217
00:13:05,293 --> 00:13:09,043
Come on, Victor. Yes, come back!

218
00:13:09,709 --> 00:13:12,001
Come on.

219
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,293
Go, go, go, go! Go!

220
00:13:14,876 --> 00:13:16,001
Go.

221
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,668
- Yes!
- Yeah!

222
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:26,876
Are you kidding me?

223
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,168
-He did it!
-Yes!

224
00:13:31,251 --> 00:13:32,668
How did he do that?

225
00:13:35,084 --> 00:13:36,501
Pumpkins.

226
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,959
It's working.

227
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,126
I'm going to go check the systems.

228
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:50,543
Finally.

229
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:54,793
It's integrating.

230
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:58,209
The Loom is weaving the branches together.
It's stabilizing.

231
00:13:58,293 --> 00:14:00,584
- Did it work, Wizard?
- You did it!

232
00:14:00,668 --> 00:14:03,084
- Oh, my God. We did it.
- Did it work?

233
00:14:03,168 --> 00:14:06,043
Oh, yes, it worked.
It's working right now.

234
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:09,084
-Really?
-It's working. Look at this.

235
00:14:11,668 --> 00:14:12,876
It worked.

236
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,918
You did it. You did it!

237
00:14:16,584 --> 00:14:18,334
-We're gonna make it.
-It worked.

238
00:14:21,459 --> 00:14:23,001
- You did it.
- Wait.

239
00:14:23,084 --> 00:14:24,168
What?

240
00:14:25,168 --> 00:14:27,376
These readings are off.

241
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:29,501
What do you mean, "off"?

242
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:32,626
I don't know. They're just off.

243
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:34,126
It can't be.

244
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,793
How can the readings be off? How...

245
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:39,793
The Loom is overloading again.

246
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,459
How can the Loom be overloading?

247
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:44,918
No.

248
00:14:47,209 --> 00:14:48,918
That's not possible.

249
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:53,376
It's not possible.

250
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,418
We increased the throughput.

251
00:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,501
The Multiplier was perfect.

252
00:14:59,168 --> 00:15:04,334
It did increase the throughput,
but there are just too many branches.

253
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:09,751
We have to get out of here.

254
00:15:10,334 --> 00:15:11,459
Wait.

255
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:18,251
The branches of time are duplicating

256
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:24,584
and expanding at an infinite rate.

257
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,043
I... I don't understand.

258
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,834
It's a scaling problem.

259
00:15:38,626 --> 00:15:41,043
But that's what we were adjusting for.

260
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:43,543
The Loom will never be able
to accommodate

261
00:15:43,668 --> 00:15:46,584
for an infinitely growing multiverse.

262
00:15:47,418 --> 00:15:50,876
You can't scale for infinite.

263
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,459
It's like trying to divide by zero.

264
00:15:59,126 --> 00:16:01,084
It can't be done.

265
00:16:01,168 --> 00:16:05,459
So, no matter how much
we increase the throughput,

266
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:09,043
it will never be enough.

267
00:16:09,126 --> 00:16:10,501
Be enough. Never enough.

268
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:14,418
-And the Loom will always fail.
-Fail.

269
00:16:16,793 --> 00:16:20,501
And the new timelines will always...

270
00:16:21,501 --> 00:16:26,168
It's almost as if as soon
as the timelines started branching,

271
00:16:27,501 --> 00:16:29,251
this was doomed to happen.

272
00:16:56,334 --> 00:16:57,501
I'm sorry.

273
00:17:17,126 --> 00:17:19,293
Sylvie, stop. Stop.

274
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:31,668
Stop.

275
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:44,584
Stop.

276
00:17:50,501 --> 00:17:51,959
I've been where you are.

277
00:17:55,709 --> 00:17:58,168
I've felt what you feel.

278
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,793
You don't want this.

279
00:18:13,084 --> 00:18:14,209
What's happening?

280
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:17,418
You're right.
What were you thinking trusting me?

281
00:18:17,876 --> 00:18:19,043
I can't be trusted.

282
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,251
You have to believe me.

283
00:18:22,043 --> 00:18:24,126
You cannot kill him.

284
00:18:24,501 --> 00:18:28,043
You must not follow through.
It all ends if you do.

285
00:18:28,126 --> 00:18:32,459
I know this sounds strange.
I've seen it. I know it.

286
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:37,084
-Get out of my way.
-I won't.

287
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,501
You've been seduced by a throne.

288
00:18:40,584 --> 00:18:42,334
The last thing I want is a throne.

289
00:18:42,418 --> 00:18:43,459
Sylvie, stop!

290
00:18:44,334 --> 00:18:48,918
If you want me to stop,
you'll have to kill me.

291
00:18:49,918 --> 00:18:52,959
Ooh!

292
00:18:53,084 --> 00:18:55,626
Close.

293
00:19:03,959 --> 00:19:05,251
See you soon.

294
00:19:06,084 --> 00:19:07,459
Sylvie, stop!

295
00:19:07,543 --> 00:19:09,418
You want to stop me,
you'll have to kill me.

296
00:19:13,168 --> 00:19:14,501
See you soon.

297
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,043
Not what you were expecting, hmm?

298
00:19:25,793 --> 00:19:28,459
You're just... a man.

299
00:19:29,959 --> 00:19:32,293
Flesh and blood.
Don't tell me I'm a disappointment.

300
00:19:40,459 --> 00:19:43,001
Hear me out.

301
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:45,209
No. No.

302
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:47,501
You want me to stop,
you'll have to kill me.

303
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:58,126
If you want to stop me,
you'll have to kill me.

304
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:10,126
See you soon.

305
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,251
Want to stop me,
you have to kill me.

306
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:16,043
-If you want to stop me...
-I have to kill you, I get it.

307
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:19,626
Why do you never try to stop her?
Fight back? Do something.

308
00:20:29,418 --> 00:20:33,293
So, how many times have you been at this?

309
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:38,126
-What did you do?
-Oh, come on.

310
00:20:38,209 --> 00:20:41,043
You're not telling me
you haven't learned how to pause...

311
00:20:41,501 --> 00:20:43,793
time... yet.

312
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:47,626
I figured you'd be way past that.

313
00:20:48,793 --> 00:20:51,584
Don't worry, lover boy. She's okay.

314
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,293
But she is in the eye line a little bit.
So why don't we just...

315
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,543
So, this,

316
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,501
this isn't the first time
we've had this conversation, is it?

317
00:21:06,584 --> 00:21:08,959
-How did you know?
-I know about the slipping.

318
00:21:11,334 --> 00:21:13,876
And who do you think paved that road?

319
00:21:15,043 --> 00:21:16,793
Any guesses? Survey says...

320
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:20,543
He Who Remains.

321
00:21:20,626 --> 00:21:21,793
Bingo!

322
00:21:23,001 --> 00:21:26,376
Here you were, slipping through time.

323
00:21:27,293 --> 00:21:29,834
Thinking you were,
you were sticking it to the system.

324
00:21:29,918 --> 00:21:31,876
Gonna beat the man. And then... Whoop!

325
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,418
Here he is.

326
00:21:37,168 --> 00:21:44,126
Kiddo, did you really think I was just
gonna sit back and let her kill me?

327
00:21:45,293 --> 00:21:47,293
And that'd be it? Zip? Nada?

328
00:21:47,376 --> 00:21:49,251
RIP HWR?

329
00:21:49,793 --> 00:21:52,001
No, I told you.

330
00:21:53,584 --> 00:21:56,168
Reincarnation, baby.

331
00:22:00,084 --> 00:22:01,793
"We die with the dying.

332
00:22:04,793 --> 00:22:06,334
"We're born with the dead."

333
00:22:09,876 --> 00:22:12,876
Uh-huh. Okay. So, this is a lot for you.

334
00:22:13,334 --> 00:22:18,293
I get it. So why don't you just go through
this a couple thousand more times?

335
00:22:18,376 --> 00:22:19,418
Get your bearings.

336
00:22:19,501 --> 00:22:22,376
And then you just, you just let me know.

337
00:22:23,293 --> 00:22:25,626
Okay, when you're ready
to have a conversation.

338
00:22:25,709 --> 00:22:26,751
Okay?

339
00:22:40,376 --> 00:22:42,251
And what makes you think...

340
00:22:43,459 --> 00:22:47,043
this is the first time
we've had this conversation?

341
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:57,334
Tsst.

342
00:22:58,709 --> 00:23:01,001
Well done. You're my favorite.

343
00:23:01,084 --> 00:23:03,084
When there was two of you here,
you were my favorite.

344
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,959
Okay.

345
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,001
So, seems you've figured it all out. Hmm?

346
00:23:11,084 --> 00:23:14,668
- Tell me, how is Victor...
- Timely?

347
00:23:14,751 --> 00:23:17,293
-Of course you know about your...
-Wait. Don't tell me.

348
00:23:17,376 --> 00:23:23,043
You're, you're having some, some,
some problems with the Temporal Loom.

349
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:27,168
-Scaling problem.
-Scaling problem? That's what he told you?

350
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:29,459
Victor told you
it's a scaling problem? Wow.

351
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:32,668
No. No, there's no, there's no problem.

352
00:23:33,251 --> 00:23:34,918
It destroyed the TVA.

353
00:23:37,334 --> 00:23:40,418
The Temporal Loom is a failsafe.

354
00:23:41,251 --> 00:23:45,209
When the Loom is overloaded with branches,

355
00:23:45,293 --> 00:23:49,293
it deletes the ones
that aren't supposed to be there.

356
00:23:49,376 --> 00:23:54,459
Everything except the Sacred Timeline.

357
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:57,459
And the TVA,

358
00:23:57,543 --> 00:23:59,126
that's just,
that's just collateral damage.

359
00:23:59,209 --> 00:24:01,626
Look, no biggie. Easy to rebuild.

360
00:24:04,626 --> 00:24:07,751
-What a waste of time.
-And as you may or may not know,

361
00:24:07,834 --> 00:24:11,001
my Variants are already out there.

362
00:24:11,084 --> 00:24:12,084
We'll find them.

363
00:24:12,168 --> 00:24:13,918
-There's too many.
-I won't stop.

364
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:15,876
-Doesn't matter.
-Never stopped me before.

365
00:24:17,918 --> 00:24:19,209
I know, champ.

366
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:25,251
But the outcome to this equation remains,

367
00:24:26,459 --> 00:24:27,834
remains the same.

368
00:24:29,584 --> 00:24:30,709
You lose.

369
00:24:34,834 --> 00:24:36,084
I know.

370
00:24:39,251 --> 00:24:40,251
I know.

371
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,126
Shake it off.

372
00:25:03,376 --> 00:25:05,084
I'll change the equation.

373
00:25:06,876 --> 00:25:08,043
I'll break your Loom.

374
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:14,876
Um... But the Loom prevents a brutal war

375
00:25:15,918 --> 00:25:19,501
where nothing survives, Loki.
Not even the Sacred Timeline.

376
00:25:22,501 --> 00:25:25,084
Okay, let's try it this way, every...

377
00:25:26,501 --> 00:25:30,709
every moment of peace

378
00:25:30,793 --> 00:25:33,168
you've ever experienced

379
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:37,126
was yours because I was here.

380
00:25:38,459 --> 00:25:39,668
Alone,

381
00:25:41,209 --> 00:25:43,043
at the end of time,

382
00:25:45,126 --> 00:25:46,376
keeping watch.

383
00:25:48,251 --> 00:25:49,251
I understand.

384
00:25:49,334 --> 00:25:50,918
But you want to break the Loom.

385
00:25:51,043 --> 00:25:55,126
What do you think would happen
to your friends?

386
00:26:00,209 --> 00:26:01,209
Hmm.

387
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:06,084
I made the tough choices.
That's why I get the big chair.

388
00:26:09,501 --> 00:26:11,084
I keep us safe.

389
00:26:12,709 --> 00:26:14,709
Can't you see what I'm offering here...

390
00:26:16,209 --> 00:26:17,293
is mercy?

391
00:26:21,626 --> 00:26:24,501
For me, or for you?

392
00:26:29,959 --> 00:26:30,959
No.

393
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:35,084
I'll find another way.

394
00:26:42,459 --> 00:26:43,459
Okay.

395
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:55,501
And around and around and around we go.

396
00:26:57,168 --> 00:26:58,251
Let's see it.

397
00:26:59,334 --> 00:27:01,001
Make the hard choice.

398
00:27:01,668 --> 00:27:05,251
Break the Loom and you cause a war
that kills us all. Game over.

399
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,209
Or, kill her,

400
00:27:10,459 --> 00:27:13,334
and we protect what we can.

401
00:27:25,376 --> 00:27:27,001
What are you gonna do?

402
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:30,709
- Finish what I started.
- Which is?

403
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:33,334
-Claim my throne.
-You wanna be king?

404
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,293
I don't want to be, I was born to be.

405
00:27:35,376 --> 00:27:38,043
I know, but king of what, exactly?

406
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:45,459
Okay, so let's get into it.
The man who would be king...

407
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:47,626
-No, Mobius, stop.
-Stop? We just started.

408
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:49,418
-We gotta keep going.
-No, no, no.

409
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,834
I know what this is.

410
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:53,209
What is it?

411
00:27:53,293 --> 00:27:56,209
You want to know what makes Loki tick?

412
00:27:56,293 --> 00:27:57,334
Yes.

413
00:27:57,418 --> 00:28:00,459
You want to know why I do what I do?

414
00:28:00,543 --> 00:28:02,918
Why I have so much range?

415
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:04,376
Yeah.

416
00:28:04,459 --> 00:28:05,834
You're gonna make notes,

417
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:09,751
and then you're gonna click that button
on that machine

418
00:28:09,834 --> 00:28:13,668
and then you're gonna play out scenes
from my whole life,

419
00:28:13,751 --> 00:28:16,709
how it's all meant to be,
past, present, future.

420
00:28:16,793 --> 00:28:18,709
Burdened with glorious purpose.

421
00:28:19,626 --> 00:28:21,084
My life was a waste of time.

422
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:24,418
Okay, it looks like someone
got a hold of the set list.

423
00:28:24,501 --> 00:28:27,043
-How are you doing this?
-Mobius, I need your help.

424
00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:30,584
Well, I'm listening.

425
00:28:30,668 --> 00:28:34,584
How do you choose who lives and who dies?

426
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:38,043
Prune. We prune around here
and we don't choose the Time-Keepers,

427
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:40,334
-they have that responsibility.
-The Time-Keepers.

428
00:28:40,418 --> 00:28:41,876
Dictate the proper flow of time.

429
00:28:41,959 --> 00:28:44,876
They're busy untangling the epilogue
from its infinite branches.

430
00:28:44,959 --> 00:28:46,834
-Exactly, yeah.
-I know the dogma,

431
00:28:46,918 --> 00:28:48,834
but really, you're the one doing it.

432
00:28:48,918 --> 00:28:52,168
Because it was the proper flow of time.

433
00:28:52,251 --> 00:28:55,668
-What comfort is that?
-Comfort? Well, there's no comfort.

434
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:58,251
You're not gonna find comfort at the TVA.

435
00:28:59,001 --> 00:29:01,876
You wanna hear a good story?
Listen to this one.

436
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:05,459
A couple of Hunters went out on a mission
somewhere near the Black Sea

437
00:29:05,543 --> 00:29:09,209
to find a Variant who's gonna be
responsible for 5,000 deaths,

438
00:29:09,293 --> 00:29:12,918
5,000 deaths that were not
in the proper flow of time.

439
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,751
They get there
and there's a little hiccup.

440
00:29:16,293 --> 00:29:18,834
The Variant is an eight-year-old boy.

441
00:29:19,876 --> 00:29:21,834
He was just minding his own business.

442
00:29:22,668 --> 00:29:25,876
Swimming with his brother,
jumping off the dock.

443
00:29:28,126 --> 00:29:31,459
And one of the Hunters
who never had trouble pruning before,

444
00:29:31,543 --> 00:29:35,168
he had never hesitated,
but that day he did.

445
00:29:35,251 --> 00:29:36,584
He paused.

446
00:29:37,084 --> 00:29:39,876
Timeline started to branch,
more Variants appeared.

447
00:29:39,959 --> 00:29:42,959
Happened so fast, his partner
had to step in and prune the kid.

448
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:46,126
But by then, cat was out of the bag.

449
00:29:47,168 --> 00:29:48,626
Couple Hunters died.

450
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,418
All because that one Hunter,

451
00:29:52,459 --> 00:29:54,418
he lost sight of the big picture.

452
00:29:55,876 --> 00:29:58,293
Gotta keep the big picture in mind.

453
00:30:00,793 --> 00:30:01,793
Hmm.

454
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,459
Most purpose is more burden than glory.

455
00:30:07,209 --> 00:30:09,918
And trust me,
you never wanna be the guy who avoids it

456
00:30:10,001 --> 00:30:11,918
'cause you can't live with the burden.

457
00:30:16,668 --> 00:30:18,001
How do you live with it?

458
00:30:22,584 --> 00:30:24,043
Scar tissue.

459
00:30:27,001 --> 00:30:29,709
What happened to your partner?

460
00:30:30,918 --> 00:30:33,918
The Hunter who pruned the boy
when you couldn't.

461
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,251
Oh, things worked out fine for her.

462
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,793
She actually became a judge.

463
00:30:38,709 --> 00:30:43,543
You know, she's the reason you're here
instead of dust in a TVA vent.

464
00:30:46,376 --> 00:30:47,959
Renslayer.

465
00:30:48,043 --> 00:30:52,459
She knew the hard thing to do
was the thing that had to be done.

466
00:30:55,543 --> 00:30:57,834
And by hard, I mean impossible.

467
00:30:59,334 --> 00:31:01,168
No, there's no comfort.

468
00:31:01,876 --> 00:31:03,626
You just choose your burden.

469
00:31:08,293 --> 00:31:09,834
Thank you, Mobius.

470
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:51,043
Is this it?

471
00:31:52,793 --> 00:31:54,126
We...

472
00:31:57,543 --> 00:31:59,084
There's nowhere left to go.

473
00:32:09,918 --> 00:32:11,043
What's happening?

474
00:32:13,543 --> 00:32:15,168
We're outside time.

475
00:32:18,459 --> 00:32:19,584
How?

476
00:32:21,751 --> 00:32:24,084
I finally learned to control
the time slipping.

477
00:32:28,251 --> 00:32:29,668
I went back.

478
00:32:29,751 --> 00:32:31,876
I thought I could fix the Loom.

479
00:32:32,751 --> 00:32:34,376
It's a failsafe.

480
00:32:36,293 --> 00:32:40,626
It was designed to protect
the Sacred Timeline and nothing else.

481
00:32:40,709 --> 00:32:42,168
Of course it is.

482
00:32:43,001 --> 00:32:44,501
I'm out of options, Sylvie.

483
00:32:45,543 --> 00:32:46,959
I've tried everything.

484
00:32:48,668 --> 00:32:50,584
The only way that anything survives...

485
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:54,251
Is if I never kill He Who Remains
in the first place.

486
00:32:57,293 --> 00:33:00,459
So you have to kill me.

487
00:33:19,459 --> 00:33:22,959
I'm not giving you my blessing,
if that's what you're waiting for.

488
00:33:25,584 --> 00:33:26,876
What do I do?

489
00:33:29,501 --> 00:33:33,334
It's the Sacred Timeline, or nothing.

490
00:33:33,418 --> 00:33:36,209
It's not enough
to protect the Sacred Timeline, Loki.

491
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:40,334
Even down there,
it's full of death and destruction

492
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:41,668
and injustice.

493
00:33:42,751 --> 00:33:45,793
Do you really wanna be the god
who takes away everyone's free will

494
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:46,918
so you can protect that?

495
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:50,793
But what good is free will
if everyone's dead?

496
00:33:50,876 --> 00:33:53,126
And who are you to say
we can't die trying?

497
00:33:54,459 --> 00:33:56,918
Who are you to decide
we can't die fighting?

498
00:33:57,918 --> 00:34:01,001
You're replacing one nightmare
with another.

499
00:34:01,668 --> 00:34:03,668
I grew up in apocalypses, Loki.

500
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,834
I've lived through enough of them to know

501
00:34:06,918 --> 00:34:09,376
that sometimes
it's okay to destroy something.

502
00:34:12,501 --> 00:34:13,501
If...

503
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:21,126
If there's a hope
that you can replace that thing

504
00:34:24,043 --> 00:34:25,543
with something better.

505
00:34:43,876 --> 00:34:45,793
Welcome, He Who Remains.

506
00:35:33,376 --> 00:35:34,459
Loki.

507
00:35:38,126 --> 00:35:39,126
Hey.

508
00:35:47,001 --> 00:35:49,251
Loki, what are you doing?

509
00:35:52,626 --> 00:35:54,084
- Open the door.
- Loki.

510
00:35:57,168 --> 00:35:58,709
I know what I want.

511
00:36:01,959 --> 00:36:04,168
I know what kind of god I need to be...

512
00:36:06,959 --> 00:36:08,043
for you.

513
00:36:10,126 --> 00:36:11,334
For all of us.

514
00:36:13,751 --> 00:36:14,793
-No!
-Loki!

515
00:36:32,918 --> 00:36:34,334
I need to get out there.

516
00:38:25,959 --> 00:38:27,459
The branches are dying.

517
00:40:00,584 --> 00:40:01,918
He's giving us a chance.

518
00:42:47,334 --> 00:42:49,626
Your team
are doing an excellent job.

519
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:51,418
Let me know if you need anything.

520
00:42:52,834 --> 00:42:54,668
How're things going over here?

521
00:42:54,751 --> 00:42:57,251
Hey, y'all, I'm Miss Minutes.

522
00:42:58,293 --> 00:43:00,584
And are we sure she won't...

523
00:43:01,459 --> 00:43:03,543
-Try to kill us all?
-Yeah.

524
00:43:07,584 --> 00:43:10,334
You don't instill confidence, O.B.

525
00:43:14,751 --> 00:43:17,584
- Are you headed to the War Room?
- Yeah.

526
00:43:17,668 --> 00:43:19,543
Let them know
I'll be up in a moment?

527
00:43:19,626 --> 00:43:21,709
I'll do you one better,
I'll save you a seat.

528
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,793
Hey, you. You okay?

529
00:43:27,918 --> 00:43:31,418
I got those reports
on the Variants of He Who Remains.

530
00:43:32,084 --> 00:43:34,543
-Do any of them know that we exist yet?
-Nope.

531
00:43:34,626 --> 00:43:38,793
I guess one of 'em caused a little bit
of a ruckus on 616 adjacent realm,

532
00:43:38,876 --> 00:43:41,251
but they handled it.
So, we're all good for now.

533
00:43:41,334 --> 00:43:42,918
That's all we can ask for.

534
00:43:43,459 --> 00:43:46,584
-Are you headed up?
-Yeah, I'll meet you up there.

535
00:44:13,751 --> 00:44:16,168
Casey said he's gonna
get these taken down.

536
00:44:17,126 --> 00:44:18,959
Although it is a good reminder.

537
00:44:19,043 --> 00:44:23,126
Those who do not remember
the past are, you know...

538
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:25,043
Hmm.

539
00:44:26,543 --> 00:44:28,168
So, when we get in there...

540
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:31,126
Yeah, funny you should
mention that because...

541
00:44:36,918 --> 00:44:38,334
You're leaving.

542
00:44:43,418 --> 00:44:48,334
I mean, you think the TVA is gonna miss
a tired, washed-up old analyst

543
00:44:48,418 --> 00:44:50,001
with a heart of gold?

544
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:53,751
I think there's one or two who will.

545
00:44:58,334 --> 00:45:04,293
I... I am, I, I've gotta go see
what exactly it is we've been...

546
00:45:05,334 --> 00:45:07,168
protecting for all this time.

547
00:45:10,918 --> 00:45:13,543
Well, if you ever want a seat in there,

548
00:45:15,293 --> 00:45:16,293
it's yours.

549
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:19,168
Thanks.

550
00:45:25,709 --> 00:45:27,251
They need you in there.

551
00:45:41,834 --> 00:45:43,168
Are you scared?

552
00:45:44,668 --> 00:45:45,959
Oh, yeah.

553
00:48:27,001 --> 00:48:29,209
He's going in, no one can stop him.
Help!

554
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:32,918
We're on the same team. Help!

555
00:48:33,001 --> 00:48:34,876
The inmates are running the asylum.

556
00:48:34,959 --> 00:48:36,459
Okay, okay, peace, peace.

557
00:48:36,543 --> 00:48:38,918
Dinner, come on,
let's find some common ground.

558
00:48:39,001 --> 00:48:41,459
Here we go. Crazy two.

559
00:49:07,168 --> 00:49:09,043
The yard could do with a bit of work.

560
00:49:11,793 --> 00:49:13,709
No. It's great.

561
00:49:14,793 --> 00:49:17,709
Christ, it's the best house on the block.

562
00:49:18,751 --> 00:49:20,334
Never look, never know.

563
00:49:24,126 --> 00:49:26,418
It's weird that Loki's not here, isn't it?

564
00:49:28,334 --> 00:49:29,501
Yeah.

565
00:49:33,043 --> 00:49:35,751
Well, see you around, I guess.

566
00:49:37,126 --> 00:49:38,418
Where are you gonna go?

567
00:49:41,209 --> 00:49:42,459
You?

568
00:49:43,334 --> 00:49:45,626
I might just wait here for a little bit.

569
00:49:51,168 --> 00:49:53,001
Let time pass.
